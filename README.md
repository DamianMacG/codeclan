# Setup & Installation

Clone the Repository:  
git clone https://github.com/caffreydev/codeclan.git

Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the frontend project:  
cd codeclan

Install the necessary dependencies:  
npm install

# Firebase Setup

Firebase is used to provide authentication, data storage, and other features in CodeClan. To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Firebase Project**:
   If you don't have a Firebase project, you can create one by visiting the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

2. **Obtain Firebase Configuration**:

   - Go to your project settings in the Firebase Console.
   - Click on the "Your apps" section and select the web app (</> icon).
   - Find the "Config" option (Project Settings - General) to access your Firebase configuration object.
   - Replace the placeholder values in the configuration with your actual Firebase project settings.
   - It should look like this but with your private details:

   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: 'your-api-key',
     authDomain: 'your-auth-domain',
     projectId: 'your-project-id',
     storageBucket: 'your-storage-bucket',
     messagingSenderId: 'your-messaging-sender-id',
     appId: 'your-app-id',
   };
   ```

## Secure Private Keys:

To keep your Firebase configuration settings secure, create an .env.local file in the root directory of your project and store your private keys there.
Make sure to add your .env file to your project's .gitignore to keep your private keys from being exposed in version control.

### .env.local

- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id

### Run locallly
